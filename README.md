## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)**: A super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler written in Rust.

### Backend
- **SailsJS**: A web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps.
- **ExpressJS**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

### API Communication
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### Email Functionality
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for sending emails.
- **Gmail**: Used as the SMTP server for handling email transactions.

## Architecture Overview

The d rock project is built on a modern, scalable architecture that separates concerns between the frontend and backend:

1. The frontend, powered by Vite + React + SWC, provides a fast and responsive user interface.
2. The backend, built with SailsJS and ExpressJS, handles business logic and API endpoints.
3. MongoDB serves as the database, storing and retrieving data efficiently.
4. Axios facilitates communication between the frontend and backend.
5. SMTP, configured with Gmail, enables email functionality within the application.

## Frontend

The frontend of d rock is built using Vite, React, and SWC, offering several advantages:

- **Vite**: Provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **React**: Enables the creation of reusable UI components and efficient rendering.
- **SWC**: Compiles JavaScript/TypeScript much faster than traditional compilers, improving build times.

This combination results in a highly performant and developer-friendly frontend environment.

## Backend

The backend leverages the power of SailsJS and ExpressJS:

- **SailsJS**: Offers a complete MVC framework with built-in ORM, making it easy to create scalable, real-time applications.
- **ExpressJS**: Provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, allowing for flexible and minimalist server-side applications.

This dual-framework approach combines the best of both worlds, offering structure and flexibility for various backend requirements.

## Database

MongoDB serves as the primary database for d rock:

- **Document-oriented**: Allows for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **High performance**: Provides fast read/write operations.
- **Easy integration**: Works seamlessly with Node.js-based backends.

## API Communication

Axios is used for making HTTP requests between the frontend and backend:

- **Promise-based**: Simplifies asynchronous operations.
- **Interceptors**: Allows for easy request and response transformations.
- **Automatic transforms**: Handles JSON data seamlessly.

## Email Functionality

The project incorporates email capabilities using SMTP with Gmail:

- **SMTP**: Enables sending emails directly from the application.
- **Gmail integration**: Utilizes Gmail's SMTP server for reliable email delivery.

This feature allows for user notifications, password resets, and other email-based functionalities.
